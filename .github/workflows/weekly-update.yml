# =============================================================================
#  Weekly Version Check To Update
# =============================================================================
# This workflow runs weekly, builds the latest SQLite source code and updates
# the version file.
#
# If all tests are successful and the SQLite version has changed, a new Pull
# Request is created to update the version file.
#
# NOTE:
# You need to set the `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable in the repo's
# settings at GitHub:
#     [Settings]-[Secrets]-[Actions secrets]
#
# To generate a new token go to:
#     https://github.com/settings/tokens
#     * You need add the "repo" scope to the token but no more.
